What is a Headers Exchange in RabbitMQ?

A Headers Exchange in RabbitMQ routes messages based on message headers instead of the 
routing key. This is particularly useful when routing decisions depend on multiple 
attributes or metadata about the message rather than a simple key.

Key Features of Headers Exchange

    Header-based Routing:
        The routing is determined by headers attached to the message properties 
        (IBasicProperties.Headers).
        Headers are key-value pairs.

    x-match Binding Argument:
        x-match determines how the exchange matches headers:
            x-match = all: All specified headers must match (logical AND).
            x-match = any: At least one header must match (logical OR).

    Flexible Matching:
        Unlike direct or topic exchanges, headers allow routing based on arbitrary metadata, 
        not just strings.

    No Routing Key:
        The routingKey is ignored for headers exchanges.
